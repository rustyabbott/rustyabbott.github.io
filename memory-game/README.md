## Instructions

Welcome to my first application written with JavaScript! This classic memory game allows players to test their memory by flipping over cards and matching the symbols. Click a card to flip it over, then click another to find a match. There are 16 cards and 8 pairs. Once all 8 pairs are matched, you will be shown a modal with your game statistics. Enjoy!
